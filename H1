- Braiterman et al 2020: Threat modeling manifesto

Threat modeling is a process where potential risk to the system is identified systematically before it 
can be exploited.

# The four main questions are:

1. What are we working on?
2. What can go wrong?
3. What are we going to do about it?
4. Did we do a good enough job?

- Shostack 2022: Welcome to the Worlds Shortest Threat Modeling Course

We threat model to anticipate the problems before it becomes the real problem and ideally when the threat is inexpensive to 
deal with. It starts with simple drawing or flow diagrams, which show how information moves. This helps to make the things 
we build as secure as we need it.

Thread model usex <bold>STRIDE</bold> models to identify threats.

- Spoofing
- Tampering
- Repudiation
- Information Disclosure
- Denial of Service
- Elevation of Privilege

STRIDE model helps us to be structured in how we think about the threats.

- Darknet diaries episode 92: The Pirate Bay

In early 2000s, Pirate Bay was founded in Sweden by a group of people. Among those Gottfrid, Fredrik, and Peter shared
common belief that access to the information should be free and challenged the traditional copyright laws. Pirate Bay 
actually was like a search engine where one could find index of the content rather than the content itself. The site 
faced immense pressure from different organizationa and government, but it managed to stay online. It became the symbol 
of digital resistance. 

I guess the money and power corrupts anything, to overcome this information should be free.

- Security Hygiene

Any users should atleast follow few basic security practices to protect themselves. It is just like locking your door 
before you leave your home. In the online world, users should follow these steps:

1. Use strong and unique password with multifactor authentication and also limiting the people with full access.
2. Devices and softwares should be updated in timely fashion.
3. Use Antivirus/Anti-Malware
4. Sensitive data should be encrypted and all devices should have screen lock.
5. Backup the data
6. Use secure connection only
7. Maintain log of system to enable see who logged incase of suspecious activities

- Make-belief boogie-man - a threat model for imaginary company.

MediVault Health Inc. is an imaginary healthcare technology company that provides cloud based Electronic Health Record 
System and telehealth services. 

# I will use the four main questions threat modeling:

1. What are we working on?
2. What can go wrong?
3. What are we going to do about it?
4. Did we do a good enough job?


We must work on securing the assets. 

1. What are we working on? & 2. What can go wrong?

* Patient Health Records (EHR Database) - Critical - Breach can result in fines, lost trust, and lawsuits
* Telehealth Session Data (Real-time video/chat) - Critical - Breach can result in fines, lost trust, and lawsuits
* Clinician Portal (Web App) - High - System goes down results in loss
* Billing/Payment System - High - Fraud impacts revenue
* Internal Admin Tools - Medium - Breach could lead to larger breach
* Employee Gaming Server - Low - Can be used to breach other system

3. What are we going to do about it?

We must follow Risk Mitigation Strategies like limiting excess points, carry out annual review of the security, and 
continious testing of usability and vulnerabilities.

4. Did we do a good enough job?

We can know that by doing the followings:

- Penetrating testing
- Keeping system current with new features
- Annual assessment of third party vendor like payment API provider's security
- Continuous testing
